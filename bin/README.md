# Exercise 7

This exercise is about using Weka with Java. 

Since it's the semester break, the exercise is due January 6, 2021.

## Step 1

Please clone this repository onto your local computer. On the command line, you would enter: `git clone https://github.com/idh-cologne-tools-ressourcen-infra/exercise-07`, and create a new branch using your UzK username as a name.

## Step 2

Download the `weka.jar`-file and add it to the libraries in your development environment (Eclipse: Project properties → Java Build Path → Libraries).

## Step 3

Write a java program that repeats what you have done for exercise 6: Load the data set, apply filter(s) and predict sentiment scores. 

To give you an easier start, the repository contains a Java class `Main` in the package `de.ukoeln.idh.teaching.tri.ex07`, in the directory `src`. The main function in this class corresponds to the main function we discussed in class.

## Step 4

Commit your program to the repository and push it to the repository.
